        I like basketball because its fun to play, if youre decent. and its even
        more fun to watch. My favourite player is probably Ja Morant because hes
        fast, he has some flashy dunks, he can shoot, and can take ankles. But
        even better he is really good at postering people that are a lot bigger
        then him

      <p>
        Fortnite is one of my favourite things because its fun to play, good or
        not, its a lot better when your friends are playing with you. And if
        your really good you can make a lot of money playing a free game. I also
        really like the competitiveness in fortnite because thats what makes in
        interesting and it builds your skills at the game.

        Tacos are my favourite food to eat, I could 100% eat it everday, either
        for a snack or dinner, even if I get big, I like to eat my nachos with
        cheese,pulled pork,tomatoes,olives,halepinos, peppers, and obviously
        some sort of plain chips.
